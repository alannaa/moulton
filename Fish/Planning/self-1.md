## Self-Evaluation Form for Milestone 1

### General 

We will run self-evaluations for each milestone this semester.  The
graders will evaluate them for accuracy and completeness.

Every self-evaluation will go out into your Enterprise GitHub repo
within a short time after the milestone deadline, and you will have 24
hours to answer the questions and push back a completed form.

This one is a practice run to make sure you get


### Specifics 

- does your analysis cover the following ideas:

  - the need for an explicit Interface specification between the (remote) AI 
    players and the game system?
	  - Yes, this is encapsulated in the Communication component in the system memo.

  - the need for a referee sub-system for managing individual games
	  - No, we mistakenly assumed that we would only be running a single game instead of a tournament.

  - the need for a tournament management sub-system for grouping
    players into games and dispatching to referee components
	  - No, same answer as above.

- does your building plan identify concrete milestones with demo prototypes:

  - for running individual games
	  - Yes, itâ€™s in bullet 3 in Milestones, as that's when we finish implementing all the game logic,
      except for the remote communication part.

  - for running complete tournaments on a single computer 
	  - No, we did not understand the prompt fully, so we only run individual games locally or
      remotely.

  - for running remote tournaments on a network
	  - No, but we are running a single game on a network. (Milestones, Bullet 5)

- for the English of your memo, you may wish to check the following:

  - is each paragraph dedicated to a single topic? does it come with a
    thesis statement that specifies the topic?
	  - No, we did not use paragraphs, We did bullet points that served the purpose of being more succinct than paragraphs.

  - do sentences make a point? Do they run on?
	  - Yes to 1, and no to 2. Each sentence serves simply to explain the relevant concept or part. The memo reads more like a list of features than a project pitch.

  - do sentences connect via old words/new words so that readers keep
    reading?
	  - Yes, each piece directly references every other piece that it interacts with. First example is in Systems memo, Referee bullets

  - are all sentences complete? Are they missing verbs? Objects? Other
    essential words?
	  - Yes, each sentence is complete.

  - did you make sure that the spelling is correct? ("It's" is *not* a
    possessive; it's short for "it is". "There" is different from
    "their", a word that is too popular for your generation.)
	  - Yes, our spelling and grammar is correct.

The ideal feedback are pointers to specific sentences in your memo.
For PDF, the paragraph/sentence number suffices. 

For **code repos**, we will expect GitHub line-specific links.
