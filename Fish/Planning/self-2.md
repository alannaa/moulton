## Self-Evaluation Form for Milestone 2

A fundamental guideline of Fundamentals I, II, and OOD is to design
methods and functions systematically, starting with a signature, a
clear purpose statement (possibly illustrated with examples), and
unit tests.

Under each of the following elements below, indicate below where your
TAs can find:

- the data description of tiles, including an interpretation:
  - [link](https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/mabank/blob/07c45c12d3d455f673523c8de80576f962aa71e5/Fish/Common/src/main/java/com/cs4500/fish/game/Tile.java#L9)
  - Interpretation is omitted since we believe the code is self-explanatory.

- the data description of boards, include an interpretation:
  - [link](https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/mabank/blob/07c45c12d3d455f673523c8de80576f962aa71e5/Fish/Common/src/main/java/com/cs4500/fish/game/Board.java#L7)
  - We drew an ascii diagram to illustrate our coordinate system.

- the functionality for removing a tile:
  - purpose:
    - [link](https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/mabank/blob/07c45c12d3d455f673523c8de80576f962aa71e5/Fish/Common/src/main/java/com/cs4500/fish/game/Board.java#L117)
  
  - signature:
    - [link](https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/mabank/blob/07c45c12d3d455f673523c8de80576f962aa71e5/Fish/Common/src/main/java/com/cs4500/fish/game/Board.java#L122)
  
  - unit tests:
    - [link](https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/mabank/blob/07c45c12d3d455f673523c8de80576f962aa71e5/Fish/Common/src/test/java/com/cs4500/fish/game/BoardTest.java#L13)

- the functiinality for reaching other tiles on the board:
  - purpose:
    - [link](https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/mabank/blob/07c45c12d3d455f673523c8de80576f962aa71e5/Fish/Common/src/main/java/com/cs4500/fish/game/Board.java#L88)
  
  - signature:
    - [link](https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/mabank/blob/07c45c12d3d455f673523c8de80576f962aa71e5/Fish/Common/src/main/java/com/cs4500/fish/game/Board.java#L92)
  
  - unit tests:
    - [link](https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/mabank/blob/07c45c12d3d455f673523c8de80576f962aa71e5/Fish/Common/src/test/java/com/cs4500/fish/game/BoardTest.java#L34)

The ideal feedback is a GitHub perma-link to the range of lines in specific
file or a collection of files for each of the above bullet points.

  WARNING: all such links must point to your commit "07c45c12d3d455f673523c8de80576f962aa71e5".
  Any bad links will result in a zero score for this self-evaluation.
  Here is an example link:
    <https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/mabank/tree/07c45c12d3d455f673523c8de80576f962aa71e5/Fish>

A lesser alternative is to specify paths to files and, if files are
longer than a laptop screen, positions within files are appropriate
responses.

In either case you may wish to, beneath each snippet of code you
indicate, add a line or two of commentary that explains how you think
the specified code snippets answers the request.
